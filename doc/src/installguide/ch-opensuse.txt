To use 3D visualization support in Qtenv  (recommended), you should
install the OpenSceneGraph-devel (3.2 or later) and osgEarth-devel (2.7 or later) packages.
These packages are not available from the official RedHat repository so you
may need to get them from different sources (e.g. rpmfind.net).

To enable the optional parallel simulation support you will need to install the
MPI package:

  $ sudo zypper install openmpi-devel

Note that 'openmpi' will not be available by default, first you need to
log out and log in again, or source your `.profile` script:

  $ . ~/.profile
