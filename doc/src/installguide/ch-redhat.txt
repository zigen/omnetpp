== Red Hat

=== Supported Releases

This chapter provides additional information for installing @OMNETPP@ on
Red Hat Enterprise Linux installations. The overall installation procedure
is described in the 'Linux' chapter.

The following Red Hat release is covered:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Desktop Workstation 7.x

It was tested on the following architectures:

* Intel 64-bit

=== Opening a Terminal

Choose 'Applications > Accessories > Terminal' from the menu.

=== Installing the Prerequisite Packages

You can perform the installation using the graphical user interface or
from the terminal, whichever you prefer.

[NOTE]
===============================================================
You will need Red Hat Enterprise Linux Desktop Workstation for @OMNETPP@.
The 'Desktop Client' version does not contain development tools.
===============================================================

==== Command-Line Installation

To install the required packages, type in the terminal:

  $ su -c 'yum install make clang lld bison flex perl \
      tcl-devel tk-devel qt-devel libxml2-devel zlib-devel \
      doxygen graphviz openmpi-devel libpcap-devel'

To use 3D visualization support in Qtenv  (recommended), you should
install the OpenSceneGraph-devel (3.2 or later) and osgEarth-devel (2.7 or later) packages.
These packages are not available from the official RedHat repository so you
may need to get them from different sources (e.g. rpmfind.net).

[NOTE]
=====================================================
You may opt to use gcc and g++ instead of the clang and clang++ compilers.
=====================================================

To install additional (optional) packages for parallel simulation and
packet capture support, type:

  $ su -c 'yum install openmpi-devel libpcap'

Note that 'openmpi' will not be available by default, it needs to be
activated in every session with the

  $ module load openmpi_<arch>

command, where `<arch>` is your architecture (usually `i386` or `x86_64`).
When in doubt, use `module avail` to display the list of available
modules. If you need MPI in every session, you may add the `module load`
command to your startup script (`.bashrc`).`


==== Graphical Installation

The graphical installer can be launched by choosing
'Applications > Add/Remove Software' from the menu.

Search for the following packages in the list. Select the checkboxes
in front of the names, and pick the latest version of each package.

The packages:

* make, clang, lld, bison, flex, perl, tcl-devel, tk-devel, qt-devel,
libxml2-devel, zlib-devel, make, doxygen, graphviz, openmpi-devel

Click 'Apply', then follow the instructions.

=== SELinux

You may need to turn off SELinux when running certain simulations.
To do so, click on 'System > Administration > Security Level > Firewall',
go to the 'SELinux' tab, and choose 'Disabled'.

You can verify the SELinux status by typing the `sestatus` command in a terminal.

[NOTE]
===============================================================
From @OMNETPP@ 4.1 on, makefiles that build shared libraries include the
`chcon -t textrel_shlib_t lib<name>.so` command that properly sets the
security context for the library. This should prevent the SELinux-related
'"cannot restore segment prot after reloc: Permission denied"' error from
occurring, unless you have a shared library which was built using an obsolete
or hand-crafted makefile that does not contain the `chcon` command.
