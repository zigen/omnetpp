Release Engineering
===================

This folder contains various scripts to create the final OMNeT++ distribution archives.
It is using a docker image that contains all necessary build tools (cross compilers, 
eclipse maven cache etc.). The docker receipts are available under the 'dockerfiles' folder.

Iniside the docker container the 'releng/makedist' script is called and the final archives
will be available in the 'releng/dist' folder.

To create a build, execute the 'build-omnetpp-in-docker' script.
