- Linux:
  o -static-libstdc++ and -static-libgcc should be added to LDFLAGS to avoid binary dependency on GLIBCXX which can cause issues with old systems
  o add -include $(OMNETPP_ROOT)/releng/ide/native/force_link_glibc_2.12.2.h to CFLAGS so the .so file will be linked with 
    GLIBC 2.12 symbols which will allow it to run on old Linux distros (GLIBC 2.12 was used on CentOS 6)
- Windows:
  o you should use the mingw cross compiler (x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++)
  o Additionally you MUST add the -mthreads option to both CFLAGS and LDFLAGS otherwise the resulting lib will CRASH.
  o you should add the include path the the JDK include files manually (they should be present somewhere in the docker
    build image so cross compilation will work.) Also the platform specific include dir should be added.
- macOS:
  o compiler and tools should use the 'x86_64-apple-darwin20.4-' prefix.
  o you should add the include path the the JDK include files manually (they should be present somewhere in the docker
    build image so cross compilation will work.) Also the platform specific include dir should be added.
