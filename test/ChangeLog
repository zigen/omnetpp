	sim: cHasher: fix #846 "cHasher::add - correction & optimisation"

	Since chars were signed, converting p[i] to uint32_t does sign extension
	which is bad because we "or" such values together.

	* Adjusted backported test "statistic_autoWarmupFilter_1.test" to 5.x

	Due to the limitations of the @statistic parser/builder in OMNeT++ 5.x,
	the test can only be made to work partially. See comment in the test's
	code.

	Especially, when autoWarmupFilter=false is given, it seems to be
	necessary to add the filter "last" explicitly.

	* opp_test.pl: To make it easier to create new test cases from
	existing ones, removed %name from test file syntax; now test name
	is derived from the file name. Cleaned up error handling.
	Changed some command-line switches. Introduced {} as synonym for
	@TESTNAME@. Improved reporting.

	* runtest: accepts command-line args

2002-02-14  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* runtest: Create directory work if it doesn't exist.
