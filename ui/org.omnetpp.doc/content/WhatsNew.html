  What's New
  ==========
  
  OMNeT++ 5.7 (Sept 2021)
  -----------------------
  
  This version is intended to be the last release of the 5.x series. The main
  purpose of this release is to make it possible to write model code, primarily
  NED, which is also compatible with the upcoming OMNeT++ 6.0. It also contains
  several bug fixes backported from the 6.0 branch.
  
  For compatibility with 6.0:
  
    - NED: support for "parent.foo" syntax of parameter references (and other
      references too, see below) in expressions. Using the "parent" qualifier is
      only allowed inside submodule and connection blocks (within the curly
      braces), but not on compound module level. This change is necessary for
      being able to write NED files which are compatible with both OMNeT++ 5.7+
      and 6.x. The interpretation of parameter references in expressions have
      changed in 6.0. In 6.0, a "foo" parameter reference in a submodule means the
      parameter of the same submodule ("this.foo"), while in 5.x it means the
      parameter of the enclosing compound module (which would be expressed in 6.0
      as "parent.foo").
  
      The way to write NED files compatible with both is to always explicitly
      qualify the parameter with "this" or "parent". In a NED file written for
      5.x, prefix plain parameter references inside subcomponent curly brace blocks
      with "parent." to ensure that their meaning doesn't change in version 6.0.
  
      The same change applies to submodule and gate references as well, e.g. in
      the argument of exists() and sizeof().
  
      The change also affects the interpretation of references in expressions that
      occur in ini files.
  
      Example:
  
      network Network {
         node: Node {
           foo = foo; // CAVEAT: means "parent.foo" in 5.x, "this.foo" in 6.x!
           bar = this.foo;  // OK: unambiguous, recognized by all versions
           faa = parent.foo;  // OK: unambiguous, recognized in 5.7 and 6.x
           baz = node2.foo;  // CAVEAT: means "parent.node2.foo" in 5.x, "this.node2.foo" in 6.x!
           bax = parent.node2.foo;  // OK: unambiguous, recognized in 5.7 and 6.x
         }
      }
  
    - MatchExpression: added 'field =~ pattern' syntax as alternative to 'field(pattern)'
  
    - Added Ws, Wh, kWh, MWh to the list of recognized measurement units
  
  Core:
  
    - Statistic recording: Added a way to disable auto-adding of the warmup filter.
      One needs to specify "autoWarmupFilter=false" in the @statistic for that.
      This opens the possibility for the user to add warmup filters to a custom
      place, not just before all other filters. E.g. consider "min(warmup(foo))"
      (which is produced by auto-adding of the warmup filter), and "warmup(min(foo))"
      which might be what the user wants instead.
  
    - Fingerprints: Fixed a bug in cHasher::add(const char *) which caused some bits
      in the input not affect the fingerprint. This bugfix does not affect the
      fingerprint of most simulations, because very few fingerprints use strings
      as input.
  
    - Canvas: In cPathFigure, path parsing was refined: If an op char is missing,
      assume previous one, in accordance with the SVG specification.
  
    - cHistogram and histogram strategy classes: work around several problems
      caused by the finite precision of 'double'.
  
    - Miscellaneous other bug fixes.
  
  Cmdenv:
  
    - Added Fake GUI mode. Fake GUI means that refreshDisplay() is called
      periodically during simulation, in order to mimic the behavior of a
      graphical user interface like Qtenv. It is useful for testing simulation
      models with visualization using Cmdenv, e.g. in smoke or fingerprint tests.
      Fake GUI can be enabled with the cmdenv-fake-gui=true configuration option.
  
      The set of currently supported options for Fake GUI:
      cmdenv-fake-gui-before-event-probability,
      cmdenv-fake-gui-after-event-probability,
      cmdenv-fake-gui-on-hold-probability,
      cmdenv-fake-gui-on-hold-numsteps,
      cmdenv-fake-gui-on-simtime-probability,
      cmdenv-fake-gui-on-simtime-numsteps,
      cmdenv-fake-gui-seed.
  
  Qtenv:
  
    - Added Ctrl+W as shortcut for closing toplevel inspector windows.
  
    - Made the "Run" and "Fast" buttons "pop out" (and stop simulation) if
      triggered again. This adds a radiobutton-like behavior to these actions,
      which is handy for running the simulation for a very short time, with a
      single button.
  
    - Log Inspector: Perform "find" on plain text comment, i.e. ignore formatting
      escape sequences.
  
    - Log Inspector: After a search, scroll the found text into the middle of the
      viewport instead of just to the edge.
  
    - Find dialog: Select the entire searched text when opening the find dialog,
      to allow easier and quicker typing of a different query.
  
    - Further bug fixes.
  
  Tools:
  
    - JsonExporter: Fix: In the exported file, result items appeared under
      multiple runs due to missing filtering. Applies to both the IDE and opp_scavetool.
  
    - In the Simulation Manual, the section about opp_scavetool was out of date.
  
  Simulation IDE:
  
    - Welcome screen theme changed (circle -> solstice) due to problems
      with dark theme with the old 'circle' theme.
  
    - The Download Simulation Models dialog now supports specifying a custom
      project name and location. Also, the default project name is now coming from
      the downloaded descriptor file (not from the .project file in the archive.)
  
    - Fixed the download issues in the Download Simulation Models dialog.
  
    - NED, Ini Editor: Syntax highlight for the NED "parent" keyword
  
    - Ini Editor: group fingerprint and fakegui-related fields on a separate new
      form page.
  
    - NED Editor: Fix rendering issue with the mouse cursor for the creation tool
      in the palette.
  
    - Launcher: Print working directory and command line to console when
      debugging simulations, similar to the simple "run" mode launch.
  
    - Launcher: On macOS, use lldbmi2 for debug launches by default.
  
    - Makefile generation brought in sync with omnetpp-6pre11.
  
  Build:
  
    - Use Eclipse 4.21, and JustJ as the private JRE.
  
    - Use python3 as the interpreter for Python scripts.
  
    - opp_makemake: Makefile generation brought in sync with omnetpp-6pre11.
  
    - Got rid of a few bison warnings and properly test for Bison 3.
  
    - Fixes for the Windows build.
  
    - Updated bundled sqlite3 amalgamation sources.
